# Procedural_generated_map
On this repository you can see the code I did to create a procedural generated map using Unity 5, it has some limitation as it only works with basic shapes of room as I used a 2d matrix to build it. 

Please take a look at the Room Scheme.PDF document to understand more about how the level generator works and what kind of mazes you could get.

Hope it can help!
